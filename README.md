you'll need to configure the settings 
1. put in your ETH public address leave the quotations in.
2. put in your ETH private key to that public address you just entered
3. if you're using a hardware wallet that does not give you easy access to your private keys you can put in your wallet seed, but make sure you still put in your public address you want it to utilize
4. set the marketplace you want to use by default it's set to 1 which is opensea ,2 = raribles ,3 = conbaseNFT
5. set the network default set for 1 which is ETH , to uses the polygon network replace that with a 2 
6. set the maxspend to what you wish to spend on the NFT
7. set the nft collection ID default it's on boredapeyachtclub 
for the opensea collection name "https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub" <- take this part of the url for example: "boredapeyachtclub"
